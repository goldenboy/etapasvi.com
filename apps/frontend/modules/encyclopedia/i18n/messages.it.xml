        <source>Siddhartha Gautama, also known as Sakyamuni or Shakyamuni  ("sage of the Sakyas"), or Tathagata ("one who has thus gone" and "one who has thus come") was a spiritual teacher who founded Buddhism.</source>
        <target>Siddhārtha Gautama, detto anche Śākyamuni o Shakiamuni (saggio degli Śākya) oppure Tathāgata ("il così andato" e "il così venuto") fu maestro spirituale e fondatore del Buddismo.</target>

        <source>Gautama was born in 563 BCE in Lumbini (modern day Nepal). His mother was Queen Maya Devi. On the night Gautama was conceived, she dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side, and ten months later Gautama was born. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha, meaning "he who achieves his aim". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer Asita announced that the child would either become a great king or a great holy man.</source>
        <target>Gautama nacque nel 563 a.C. circa a Lumbini, città che oggi si trova in Nepal. Sua madre, la Regina Maya Devi, la notte del concepimento sognò che un elefante bianco con sei zanne le penetrava nel fianco e dieci mesi dopo nacque Gautama. Molte fonti narrano che la madre di Buddha morì il giorno della sua nascita, altre alcuni giorni dopo, altre ancora una settimana dopo. Al neonato venne dato il nome di Siddhārtha che significa "colui che ha raggiunto la completezza". Durante i festeggiamenti della nascita, l'astrologo Asita dichiarò che il bambino sarebbe diventato un grande monarca o una grande figura spirituale.</target>

        <target>Si narra che, come principe, Siddhārtha visse nel lusso e che avesse tre palazzi (uno per ogni stagione) costruiti appositamente per lui. Il padre, il Re Suddhodana, che intendeva fare di Siddhārtha un grande re, lo protesse dagli insegnamenti religiosi o dalla consapevolezza della sofferenza umana.</target>

        <source>At the age of 29, Siddhartha left his palace in order to meet his subjects. Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. Disturbed by this, when told that all people would eventually grow old by his charioteer Channa, the prince went on further trips where he encountered, variously, a diseased man, a decaying corpse, and an ascetic. Deeply depressed by these sights, he sought to overcome old age, illness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.</source>
        <target>All'età di 29 anni, Siddhārtha lascio il Palazzo per incontrare i suoi sudditi. Si racconta che abbia visto un anziano. Sconvolto da questo evento, quando il suo auriga gli disse che tutti finiscono per invecchiare, il Principe uscì più volte dal Palazzo ed ebbe modo di vedere un malato, un corpo in decomposizione e un asceta. Molto colpito da quello che vide, decise che avrebbe vinto la vecchiaia, la malattia e la morte vivendo come un asceta.</target>

        <source>After asceticism and concentrating on meditation Siddhartha is said to have discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way. Sitting under a pipal tree, now known as the Bodhi tree, he vowed never to arise until he had found the Truth. At the age of 35, he attained enlightenment in the fifth lunar month. Gautama, from then on, was known as the Buddha or "Awakened One." Buddha is also sometimes translated as "The Enlightened One."</source>
        <target>Si narra che Siddhārtha, dopo essersi dedicato all'ascetismo e alla meditazione, scoprì quello che i Buddisti chiamano la Via di Mezzo. Seduto sotto un ficus religiosa, chiamato anche albero della Bodhi, promise che non si sarebbe alzato sino a quando non avrebbe trovato la Verità. All'età di 35 anni, raggiunse l'illuminazione durante il quinto mese lunare. Da quel giorno Gautama passò ad essere noto come Buddha o "Risvegliato". A volte il termine Buddha viene tradotto come "Illuminato".</target>

It is used to develop insight into the true nature of phenomena (or reality) and to eradicate greed, hatred, and delusion. The Noble Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths; the first element of the Noble Eightfold Path is, in turn, an understanding of the Four Noble Truths.

This is described by the Buddha as "deathlessness" and as the highest spiritual attainment, the natural result that accrues to one who lives a life of virtuous conduct and practice in accordance with the Noble Eightfold Path. Such a life engenders increasing control over the generation of karma. It produces wholesome karma with positive results and finally allows the cessation of the origination of karma altogether with the attainment of nirvana. Otherwise, beings forever wander through the impermanent and suffering-generating realms of desire, form, and formlessness, collectively termed samsara.</source>

The term "vajra" denoted the thunderbolt, a legendary weapon and divine attribute that was made from an adamantine, or indestructible substance and which could therefore pierce and penetrate any obstacle or obfuscation. As a secondary meaning, "vajra" refers to this indestructible substance, and so is sometimes translated as "adamantine" or "diamond". A vajra (dorje) is also a scepter-like ritual object, which has a sphere at its centre, and a variable number of spokes, enfolding either end of the rod. The vajra is often traditionally employed in tantric rituals. Symbolically, the vajra may represent method as well as great bliss.</source>

In the Tibetan tradition, it is claimed that the historical Śākyamuni Buddha taught tantra, but as these are esoteric teachings, they were passed on orally first and only written down long after the Buddha's other teachings.

        <source>Tummo-meditation is commonly associated with descriptions of intense sensations of body heat, which are a partial effect, rather than a goal, of the practice. Stories and eyewitness accounts abound of yogi practitioners being able to generate sufficient heat to dry wet sheets draped around their naked bodies while sitting outside in the freezing cold. While the physiological effects of Tummo are well known, they are not the primary purpose of the meditation practice. Tummo is a tantric meditation practice that transforms and evolves the consciousness of the practitioner so that "wisdom" (prajna) and "compassion" (karuna) are manifested in the individual.</source>

        <source>Not unproblematic, Tummo must be practiced in conjunction with appropriate empowerment and under the direction of a traditionally qualified Tantric Guru. Extensive preparation and pure motivation, most specifically bodhichitta, are absolutely essential both to beneficial results and to the avoidance of physical pain and discomfort in rlung (wind or breath) disorder or other imbalances.</source>

        <source>The Buddhist tantric systems present several different models of the chakras, and for tummo the "energetic winds" (prana, rlung) are being accumulated at the navel chakra, four fingers below the navel. In Tibetan Buddhism the primary purpose of Tummo is to gain control over subtle body processes as a foundation for very advanced mystical practices analogous to Completion stages of "highest yoga tantra" (Anuttarayoga Tantra). Such refined internalized yogas are practices to support entry into the highest contemplative systems, for example the Dzogchen or Mahamudra systems.</source>

        <source>The Tamang (also known as Murmi) are one of the several ethnic groups from north central hilly region of Nepal. The word Tamang may be derived from the Tibetan words "ta" and "mang", meaning horse and soldier respectively. Living mainly north and east of the country, they constitute 5.6% of Nepal's population, which places their population at 1,280,000, slightly higher than the Newars.</source>

Due to their proximity to the Newar, a slight Hindu influence can be seen in their practices. According to the 2001 census, 88.26% of the ethnic Tamang in Nepal were Buddhists and 7.69% were Hindus. The typical song and dance of the Tamangs is "tamang selo" in which they dance to the beat of a drum called "damphu." Damphu is the traditional drum of the Tamangs.</source>

Theravada and some Mahayana sources consider a Bodhisattva as someone on the path to Buddhahood, while other Mahayana sources speak of Bodhisattvas renouncing Buddhahood. But especially in Mahayana Buddhism, it mainly refers to a being that compassionately refrains from entering nirvana in order to save others. So the Bodhisattva is a person who already has a considerable degree of enlightenment and seeks to use their wisdom to help other sentient beings to become liberated themselves.</source>

        <source>While the suttas criticize notions of an eternal, unchanging Self, they see an enlightened being as one whose changing, empirical self is highly developed. One with great self has a mind which is not at the mercy of outside stimuli or its own moods, but is imbued with self-control, and self-contained. The mind of such a one is without boundaries, not limited by attachment or I-identification. One can transform one's self from an "insignificant self" into a "great self" through practices such as loving-kindness and mindfulness. The suttas portray one disciple who has developed his mind through loving-kindness saying: "Formerly this mind of mine was limited, but now my mind is immeasurable."</source>

        <source>‘… when we look at [the] interdependence of mental and physical constituents from the perspective of Highest Yoga Tantra, there are two concepts of a person. One is the temporary person or self, that is as we exist at the moment, and this is labeled on the basis of our coarse or gross physical body and conditioned mind, and, at the same time, there is a subtle person or self which is designated in dependence on the subtle body and subtle mind. This subtle body and subtle mind are seen as a single entity that has two facets. The aspect which has the quality of awareness, which can reflect and has the power of cognition, is the subtle mind. Simultaneously, there is its energy, the force that activates the mind towards its object – this is the subtle body or subtle wind. These two inextricably conjoined qualities are regarded, in Highest Yoga Tantra, as the ultimate nature of a person and are identified as buddha nature, the essential or actual nature of mind.’</source>

This is the "true self" in the self of each being, the ideal personality, attainable by all beings due to their inborn potential for enlightenment. The "tathagatagarbha"/Buddha nature does not represent a substantial self (atman); rather, it is a positive language and expression of "sunyata" (emptiness) and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices.</source>

        <source>A common misconception among non-Buddhists is that the Buddha is the Buddhist counterpart to "God." Buddhism however, is in general non-theistic, in the sense of not teaching the existence of a supreme creator god or depending on any supreme being for enlightenment. The Buddha is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, however the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. The commonly accepted definition of the term "God" is of a being who rules and created the universe. The Buddha of the early texts gives arguments refuting the existence of such a being.</source>

        <source>Mahayana Buddhism (like Theravada Buddhism) posits no Creator or ruler God. In the Avatamsaka Sutra it says, "If you want to understand all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future, then you should view the whole universe as being created by Heart." In some major traditions of Mahayana Buddhism (the Tathagatagarbha and Pure Land streams of teaching) there is a notion of the Buddha as the omnipresent, omniscient, liberative essence of reality, and Buddhas are spoken of as generators of vast "pure lands", "Buddha lands", or "Buddha paradises", in which beings will unfailingly attain Nirvana. And thus, to some extent, this conception of the Buddha draws close to pantheistic conceptions of godhead, yet it differs in that in the Mahayana tradition, anyone can become a Buddha, as compared to general theistic religions in which it is generally considered impossible to become a god or God.</source>
