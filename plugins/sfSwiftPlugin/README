The `sfSwiftPlugin` is a symfony plugin that provides e-mail sending capabilities through the use of the Swift Mailer library http://www.swiftmailer.org/.

  {{{

If you wanÂ´t do save the Swift Mailer library in a global directory go to http://www.swiftmailer.org/download/ and extract/checkout the Swift Mailer library

=== Swift Mailer libary in a global directory ===
Copy the `autoload.yml.sample` from `%SF_PLUGINS_DIR%/sfSwiftPlugin/config/` to your symfony `%SF_CONFIG_DIR%` folder and set the path:

  {{{
autoload:
  swift_mailer_classes:
    ...
    path: /your/path/to/swift/
    ...
  }}}

== Usage ==

There is an included module called `sfSwiftMailer` that has a test emailing called `ThankYou` which you can use as an example for using the library.

Also be sure to review the docs at http://www.swiftmailer.org/wikidocs/
